## Usage Examples

### For Web Resources

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/gh/username/repo/main/script.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.example.com/gh/username/repo/main/styles.css">
```

### For GitHub Releases

```
https://cdn.example.com/releases/electron/electron/download/v28.1.0/electron-v28.1.0-win32-x64.zip
```

### Direct Linking in Documentation

The raw format is convenient for documentation:

```markdown
Download the file from [here](https://cdn.example.com/raw/username/repo/main/filename.ext)
```

## Security Considerations

- Your GitHub token is stored securely as an encrypted environment variable
- Only grant read permissions to your token
- Consider setting an expiration date on your GitHub token
- Rotate your token periodically

## Limitations

- Maximum file size: 25MB (Cloudflare Worker limit)
- Request timeout: 30 seconds

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a 404 error:
- Verify that the repository path is correct
- Check that your token has access to the repository
- Ensure the branch name is correct
